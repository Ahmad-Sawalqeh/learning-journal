# Structure web pages with HTML

##  Process & Design

> Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner.

> Target AuDience:
1. Individuals:
- What is the age range of your target audience?
- What kind of device do they use to access the web?
- How often do they use the web?

1. Companies:
- Will visitors be using the site for themselves or for someone else?
- What is the size of the company or relevant department?

> Invent some fictional visitors from your typical target audience. They will become your friends. They can influence design decisions from color palettes to level of detail in descriptions.

> You need to consider why your visitors are coming. While some people will simply chance across your website, most will visit for a specific reason. so you need to work out what information they need in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

## HTML Layout

> HTML layout elements:
- `<header>` At the Top of every page.
- `<main>` At the center of every page.
- `<footer>` At the bottom of every page.
- `<nav>` element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
- `<section>` element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
- `<artical>` element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

> Examples for HTML:

```
