# JavaScript & JQuery

## INTRODUCTION

JavaScript allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markup used ina web page while it is being viewed in the browser. also it can make the web page feel interactive by respondingto what the user dose.<br>

1. ACCESS CONTENT:<br>

1. MODIFY CONTEN:<br>
You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them.<br>

1. REACT TO EVENTS:<br>
You can specify that a script should run when a specific event has occurred.<br>

## EXPRESSIONS & OPERATORS

***Expression*** : *An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking there are two types of expressions.*<br>

- EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE, for example:<br>
`var color = 'beige'`  The value of co 1 or is now beige.<br>

- EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE, for example:<br>
`var area = 3*2;`  The value of area is now 6.<br>

***Operators*** : *Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more values.*<br>

- ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:<br>
`color = 'beige';`
- COMPARISON OPERATORS:<br>
`buy = 3 > 5;`
- ARITHMETIC OPERATORS:<br>
`area = 3 * 2;`
- LOGICAL OPERATORS:<br>
`buy= (5 > 3) && (2 < 4);`
- STRING OPERATORS:<br>
`greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Molly';`

## FUNCTIONS

Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements).<br>

> This is a basic example for a function:
```

var msg = 'Sign up to receive our newsletter for 10% off!';

 function updateMessage() {
      var el = document.getElementByld('message'};
      el .textContent = msg;
 }

 updateMessage(}; 

```
