# How Computers Work

Computers are machines manipulate the informations and performs 4 tasks:
1. Input.
1. Storage.
1. Processe.
1. Output.

> In simple words:
Take input then store information and processing and finaly output the result.<br>

In previous years the computers just made for basic calculation. but now we use them to talk to each other , play games, control reports and anything we can imagine.

> There is many types of input tools:
+ Mouse.
+ Keyboard.
+ Mice.
+ camera.

After input the information the computer store it in the memory where could be internal or external storage and process the taken informations and manipulate, also change them using some of algorithems with the series of instructions and command, after this go back to the storage to be ready for output, and the output could be text, photo and video.<br>

computer works on ones & zeros inside the computer there is a lot of wires and circuits that carry all the information in the computer using electricity by either on or off, yes or no, true or false and 1 or 0. alos with more wire (more bits) we will get more information.<br>

As there is a Binary number (1,0) and Decimal number (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) help us to present:
- Text : each letter presented as number.
- Image: each pixle presented as number.
- sound: each wave presented as number

And of course more bit gives us more quilty for sounds and images.<br>

To get the input data and deliver it as information computer need to modify and compine input signals using million of tiny electrical compunont called ***Circuit***, for example: NOT, AND, OR, Adder, Subtaction and Multiplication circuits.<br>

> ***Note*** : The smallest circuite has less distants let the electrice signal travel less and quiqly, thats why the smallest devices are the fastest one.

> There is many types of output tools:
* Screen.
* Speakers.
* printer.

> Summary:

Computers get the data from Input tools and convert it to binary data and store it to a memory using a storage tools after that computers use a center processing unit (CPU) to process the calculation, finaly the output tools works to convert the result into visical output andurstandable to the human.
