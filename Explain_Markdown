# Explain Markdown

## Markdown : its a way to express the HTML files, also its not a what you see is what you get like MS Word for example.

**I can use Markdown to:**

- Styling text by using somthing like these:
1. Italic * * ex: *Italic* .
2. Bold ** ** ex: **Bold** .
3. Strikethrough ~~ ~~ ex: ~~Strikethrough~~ .

- import links by using somthing like these:
1.for wesites we use [] to write text where the user will press on and use () to wirte the link of whatever website you want to visit.
ex: [click here to go to my website](https://github.com/Ahmad-Sawalqeh).

2.for Images we use the same way as website but we should add explanation mark ! before [], also wirte the link of the image between ().
ex: ![](http://projecteka.org/images/depositphotos_106220902-stock-photo-new-project-in-multicolor-doodle.jpg).
